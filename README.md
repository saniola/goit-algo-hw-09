## Conclusion

In the comparison between the greedy algorithm (`find_coins_greedy`) and the dynamic programming algorithm (`find_min_coins`) for finding the minimum number of coins for a given sum, the following conclusions can be drawn:

- The greedy algorithm (`find_coins_greedy`) is more efficient for quickly finding a solution for small sums and a limited set of coin denominations. It works reasonably well for small sums and has minimal computational overhead.

- The dynamic programming algorithm (`find_min_coins`) is more efficient when dealing with large sums and allows finding the minimum number of coins for any sum and any set of coin denominations. However, it requires more computational resources and time for processing large input data.

- When comparing the time taken for 10,000 repeats, it becomes clear that dynamic programming (`find_min_coins`) is significantly slower than the greedy algorithm (`find_coins_greedy`) for the given example. This is due to the nature of dynamic programming, which involves more calculations and memory usage.

- The choice between these two algorithms depends on the specific task and data volume. The greedy algorithm is suitable for quickly solving simple tasks, while dynamic programming is used for accurate and optimal solutions to more complex tasks, especially when dealing with large datasets.
